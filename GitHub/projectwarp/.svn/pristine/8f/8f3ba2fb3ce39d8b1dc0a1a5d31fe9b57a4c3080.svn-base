This will serve as our changelog to make it easier to keep track of everyone's contribution
and changes to the files(try to follow the format so it's nice and clean):

Thurs Feb 07, 2013(Daniel)

**Tweaked Mai's code with the gravity in the Flux.js file under guy.update() so it's a bit smoother.  

Thurs Feb 07, 2013(John)

**Added prototype class, still working on implementing platforms.

Saturday Feb 09, 2013(Daniel)
**Implemented Better Gravity as you accelerate when you are falling instead of falling at a constant speed.
**Implemented constraints on the bullet for the prototype so it bounces off the edges of the screen.
**Bullet also adjusted to keep going in the direction that the mouse was pointed at(used a unit vector).
**Started to mess with CollisionGrid(brine) trying to figure out how to make that work with the blocks and create a level.

Monday February 18, 2013(Daniel)

**Implemented MelonJS to be the game engine to be used.
**Began transferring the code from the Brine engine to the MelonJS engine.
**Character now shoots but not at the mouse.
**Started messing with the rotation of the player to be directed at the mouse(incomplete/buggy).

Tuesday February 19, 2013(Nathan)

**Got the bullet to shoot towards the mouse position in the new MelonJS engine.
**Got the character to warp to the bullet's position upon pressing the spacebar.
**Deletes the bullet when shooting more than one.
